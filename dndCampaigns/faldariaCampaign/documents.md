## Notes from Celeste in the old library of Five Spire

 - In *Antimagic Materials and Properties*: A Dimeritium blade to pierce shields and shatter the mask. A dragon slayer scimitar. A blight of rust. Flames stoked by the oil of a greater smoldering walrus, hot enough to crack even the greenest woods.

 - In *Devilish Dealings; Dos, Donts, and general guidance to avoid selling your soul*: Knowledge, in exchange for power in kind. How fitting. But why would she want to know… It does not matter, I will wipe her from this world before she ever gets a chance to use it. I just pray that Mathas can help me find the answers…

 - In *Devilish Dealings; Dos, Donts, and general guidance to avoid selling your soul*: I see now, how she means to trick me. It is horrible in its elegance. I see her plot, as surely as she must see mine. But she underestimates me, and she underestimates Mathas. The seeker of all knowledge ~~has~~ had more cunning than this foul creature, he would not have given me the price if he did not think it should be paid. I will not forsake his memory.

  - In *Devilish Dealings; Dos, Donts, and general guidance to avoid selling your soul*: Three deals, and we are done. Well and truly done. There is no way for her to worm out, surely?  The World Scar, healed. The walls of Five Spire town down, as they deserve. The dealmaker gets what they deserve. The Council gets what they deserve. I finally get what I deserve.

 - In a folio labelled "Hunters", containing  different demon hunters of Junisia, past and present: Need an expert, the best. She will never go along, too short sighted….Nefros Dustfall has never been able to turn down a challenge. If lucky, he may be able to convince his sister as well.

- In *Banishment: Send them back where they belong!*: The name. The ritual. The more power the better. The safer option, would not need to break the prison. But no, we are committed. No half measures.
True name? The binders would have to know, and surely one of them would cave under properly applied pressure. Or if worst comes to worst the distasteful trick with the virgins would also work. 

- In *Slaying the Primordial*: The prison protects her. Once we crack it open, the Redeemer will keep her from escaping…force her to manifest. And while manifest, Kelian and I may strike her down. Forever. *Attached to this is a crude sketch of Kelian's power store in Briggs Harbour, and note saying "Can use all the power we can get"*

- An underlined section of *Primordials and How they Manifest*:  A primordial entity cannot manifest on the material plane for more than a fraction of a minute before they dissipate. As we typically see in elemental beings, such as the leviathans, they must construct an avatar from materials native to the plane, suitable to their own essence.
*This is followed by a note* Dealmaker must have an  avatar prepared to inhabit once her prison is cracked. But made from what? Cannot touch material plane directly while imprisoned…


## Notes from Celeste in Sixth Spire Books

*These notes were found scrawled in the margins of various books in the Sixth Spire library by the Prophet of the Redeemer*

- In *A Pamphlet on the Heretics Quandary*: _On a tear stained page_ "He didn't even ask if I wanted to know. Why must he be like this? I have to ask her about it...I cant let his sacrifice go in vain. I will use this knowledge to set the world right"

- In *Crating the Celestial Bridge; a research paper on the creation and working of the celestial bridge*: "They deny me at every turn...too petty and narcissistic to see the hurt in the world they could be easing. Too prideful to work with Five Spire. But this could work...this could give us access"

- In *Stories of Radiance: Tales of the Radiant Ones*: "Mathas, you fool. They are all fools. Just as guilty as the Council, feigning at righteousness. They are just as bad as we are. Just as wretched. No one should have this cursed power. No one."

- In *Draconic Dealings; by Artur Crombsby*: "I cannot stand the hate in Crowley's eyes. I can end it all soon. The world will be free. I will be free, and I will get what I deserve"

- In *An Introduction to Group Ritual IV; Second Edition*: "How can I get the others on board? We have to do something, this war is.... working together is our only chance. If they cant see that... How can I make them see?"

- In *Banishment and Containment: A Spiritual Exterminator's Guide*: "Am I a fool to think I could succeed where they failed? I have to try... I can't hold back, their folly was thinking they could contain her. I wont make that mistake"

- In *Summoning: A Study of Induced Interplanar Travel*: "Can this really be it? All that...chaos, out of something so mundane? The Council of Five are fools.._were_ fools. I can't let this stand. They thirst for power, and when it slips though their grasping hands they watch the world burn and shrug their shoulders. Ready to try again. All they deserve is a slow and painful end"

- In *Mixing Radiance; A treatise on the applications and effects of combining magics of different sources*: "By the Radiant Ones. Maybe there is hope. Peace. I will take the offer. I can do this"

- In *Demonic Dealings; By Artur Crombsby Jr.* :  "The arrogant fools will pay for their deceit. They'll pay for what they turned me into. What they've turned the world into. What choice do I have? Mathas must have wanted this. It is too late. I will heal the wounds Ive caused."

## Letter to Brood from Five Spire

*Attached to this letter is a large book titled **The Myths and Cultures of the Peoples of the Sylvithryn Wood** by an unknown author*

Master Brood,

Typically the Grand Library does not *lend* copies of rare pre-Wrending texts such as this, but my colleagues inform me that you have rendered us a service at some considerable danger to your own person. Therefore, it is my utmost pleasure to be of assistance in your search for knowledge about full Lycanthropic Shifting with regard to the Shifter peoples.

Contained in this book are the best records I know of pertaining to the subject at hand. Its writing predates the Wrending, but sadly all more contemporary histories of the Shifters in question are *oral*, and so therefor (though I have transcriptions here) they can be treated only as hearsay and are hardly worth sending as transcriptions across the country.

As I am sure you well know, the Sylvithryn Wood came to be infested and unlivable after the Sylvithryn Flight (some 15 years after the Wrending), and has hence been known as the Rotwood. The oral histories suggest that the Shifters of the Steppes are the descendants of those who had the foresight to flee the Rotwood.

The oral histories of these tribes suggest that the ability to fully Shift into a lycanthropic form was lost at the time of the Wrending. As I am sure you will see, this seems to track with mythologies presented in the book, implying that the theory is not without foundation.

Additionally (though I must say that I hesitate to even bring it up) some oral histories suggest that the ability to Shift into Lycanthropic form is still present in some poor souls still living in the Rotwood. The histories imply that even this Shifting, though, is somehow distorted from the ideal of pre-Wrending Lycanthropic Shifting. These claims however can be bourne up by no evidence, and truly seem unlikely given what we know about the un-livability of the Rotwood. I can consider them no more than ghost stories, as it were, and would caution you in the strongest of terms to do the same.

Master Librarian of Five Spire,
Hubert Jeraldine

## Letter to Helena from Five Spire

*Inside an envelope with this letter is a golden locket*

Helly, my dearest little iris.

A sweet little birdie told me something of what you have been up to. Sounds daring. You never change.

I've been working on something since our last little bit of fun together, and when I heard old Hubert (the bore) was sending a package your way I decided to slip it in. Knowing you, I am sure you will get far more fun out of it than I ever could.

Ta-ta! XOXO

## Letter to Wilace from Bilry

Talonstone has become too hard of a place to do business. One of my most prized birds was poached by a competitor, and the whole line has been soured.

Im moving show, exploring new opportunities, and I think the best place to do it is right under our competitor's nose. Im getting old, and if I cant take risks now, then never, eh? Plus the sea air will do me good.

Reach me care of our old associate there, where the morning's beauty falls.

Be safe old friend.

- The Captain
