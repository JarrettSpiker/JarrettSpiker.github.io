## Letter to Brood from Five Spire

*Attached to this letter is a large book titled **The Myths and Cultures of the Peoples of the Sylvithryn Wood** by an unknown author*

Master Brood,

Typically the Grand Library does not *lend* copies of rare pre-Wrending texts such as this, but my colleagues inform me that you have rendered us a service at some considerable danger to your own person. Therefore, it is my utmost pleasure to be of assistance in your search for knowledge about full Lycanthropic Shifting with regard to the Shifter peoples.

Contained in this book are the best records I know of pertaining to the subject at hand. Its writing predates the Wrending, but sadly all more contemporary histories of the Shifters in question are *oral*, and so therefor (though I have transcriptions here) they can be treated only as hearsay and are hardly worth sending as transcriptions across the country.

As I am sure you well know, the Sylvithryn Wood came to be infested and unlivable after the Sylvithryn Flight (some 15 years after the Wrending), and has hence been known as the Rotwood. The oral histories suggest that the Shifters of the Steppes are the descendants of those who had the foresight to flee the Rotwood.

The oral histories of these tribes suggest that the ability to fully Shift into a lycanthropic form was lost at the time of the Wrending. As I am sure you will see, this seems to track with mythologies presented in the book, implying that the theory is not without foundation.

Additionally (though I must say that I hesitate to even bring it up) some oral histories suggest that the ability to Shift into Lycanthropic form is still present in some poor souls still living in the Rotwood. The histories imply that even this Shifting, though, is somehow distorted from the ideal of pre-Wrending Lycanthropic Shifting. These claims however can be bourne up by no evidence, and truly seem unlikely given what we know about the un-livability of the Rotwood. I can consider them no more than ghost stories, as it were, and would caution you in the strongest of terms to do the same.

Master Librarian of Five Spire,

## Letter to Helena from Five Spire

*Inside an envelope with this letter is a golden locket*

Helly, my dearest little iris.

A sweet little birdie told me something of what you have been up to. Sounds daring. You never change.

I've been working on something since our last little bit of fun together, and when I heard old Hubert (the bore) was sending a package your way I decided to slip it in. Knowing you, I am sure you will get far more fun out of it than I ever could.

Ta-ta! XOXO
