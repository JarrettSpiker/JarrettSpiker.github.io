## Enemy NPCs

A lot of this information is from the rumours Helena learned before leaving Faldaria.

- Magistrate Barretta Blackstone
    - DeFacto Mayor of Talonstone, and leader of the soldiers/guards in the area
    - Dwarven woman. Originally of common blood, she made her riches as an independent miner. After the war, she effectively bought herself a title within the Ecclesia so that she could live an easier life.
    - Known as a competent, if dispassionate leader, mostly interested in keeping things running smoothly and maintaining the status quo.
    - Brood has learned that she was the one to position the Kobolds in the Pass, and Javette has told the party that she refuses to send any soldiers to aid her in monster hunting in the mountains.
    - **Rumour:** A passionate drinker and gambler, known to stake huge bets when she gets on a roll. Prefers simple pleasures over “highborn fancies”, and not ashamed to show it.

 - Bishop Ebert Knotwise
    - The bishop in charge of Talonstone
    - A halfling man originally from Deepgrove
    - Known more as a preacher than an administrator, and generally well liked by the people of Talonstone
    - **Rumour:** Despite being known as a fairly welcoming man, keeps almost entirely to himself on his own time. Takes regular missionary trips into the countryside alone, and is rumoured to have been spotted far afield from where he claimed to be travelling

 - Archbishop Kellian De’Fris
    -  Leader of the Church of the Redeemer in Vestran Province
    -  Half Elven woman, originally from Redeemer’s Grace (the capital of the Ecclesia)
    - Known as a ruthless persecutor of Clerics of the Radiant Ones, and oversaw the destruction of Aurestar
    - **Rumour:** Reviled but deeply feared by the common people of Vestran Province. Her dissenters, illegal mages/clerics or not, are known to disappear or turn up dead.

- Edwin Briggs
  -  Governor of Vestran Province
  -  18 y.o. human. Governs Verstran Province from the city of Briggs Harbour.
  - His father sided, an Avestrian lord, sided with the Ecclesia in the invasion. As a reward he was granted governorship over the Ecclesia, but was killed towards the end of the war. The title passed on to Edwin
  - **Rumour:** Under the thumb of the Archbishop, and afraid of his own command. Given that he was 10 when his father chose to betray Avestria join the Ecclesia, he is seen as either a traitor, or a person who simple “fell into” his position, depending on who you ask
  - **Rumour:** He will be coming through Talonstone for a parade in a couple weeks time
