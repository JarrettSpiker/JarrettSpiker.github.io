## Unaligned NPCs and Organizations
The continent contains several organizations which have not (yet) sided with either Faldaria or the Ecclesia in the coming conflict. They have their own interests, and may be convinced to aid Faldaria...or stand in the party's way

### Dark Circle
The Dark Circle is a mysterious druidic organization formed of Avestrian druids and rangers. After a schism with the Circle which runs the Sanctuary over whether direct, violent, action should be taken against the Ecclesia, the Dark Circle was formed.
The party witnessed that start of a Dark Circle ritual which is used to somehow transform Priests of the Redeemer into beastly constructs of earth and plants.
 - **Brade** An elven ranger of the Dark Circle. Has an owl companion called Clarity
   - {% include hoverImage.html text="Image" image="characterImages/brade.jpg" %}

### The Brethren of Rhalagai
Not much is known of the Brethren at this time, other than that they appear to be working with the Dark Circle
 - **Vesmir** A male shifter of the Brethren, with greased hair and dark beady eyes. His voice resonates with itself, both low and whispery, and high and screechy
    - Known to be a bat lycanthrope (a werebat)
    - {% include hoverImage.html text="Image" image="characterImages/vesmir.jpg" %}


## Enemy NPCs

A lot of this information is from the rumours Helena learned before leaving Faldaria.

- Magistrate **Barretta Blackstone**
    - {% include hoverImage.html text="Image" image="characterImages/baretta.jpg" %}
    - DeFacto Mayor of Talonstone, and leader of the soldiers/guards in the area
    - Dwarven woman. Originally of common blood, she made her riches as an independent miner and mercenary. After the war, she effectively bought herself a title within the Ecclesia so that she could live an easier life.
    - Known as a competent, if dispassionate leader, mostly interested in keeping things running smoothly and maintaining the status quo.
    - Brood has learned that she was the one to position the Kobolds in the Pass, and Javette has told the party that she refuses to send any soldiers to aid her in monster hunting in the mountains.
    - Roger and Helena learned that she was once inducted into the Shield Warriors of Tor Vethren, something exceedingly rare for a hill dwarf, but has since been cast out.
    - **Rumour:** A passionate drinker and gambler, known to stake huge bets when she gets on a roll. Prefers simple pleasures over “highborn fancies”, and not ashamed to show it.

 - Bishop **Ebert Knotwise**
    - {% include hoverImage.html text="Image" image="characterImages/ebertknotwise.png" %}
    - The bishop in charge of Talonstone
    - A halfling man originally from Deepgrove
    - Known more as a preacher than an administrator, and generally well liked by the people of Talonstone
    - **Rumour:** Despite being known as a fairly welcoming man, keeps almost entirely to himself on his own time. Takes regular missionary trips into the countryside alone, and is rumoured to have been spotted far afield from where he claimed to be travelling

 - Archbishop **Kellian De’Fris**
    -  Leader of the Church of the Redeemer in Vestran Province

  - His father sided, an Avestrian lord, sided with the Ecclesia in the invasion. As a reward he was granted governorship over the Ecclesia, but was killed towards the end of the war. The title passed on to Edwin
  - **Rumour:** Under the thumb of the Archbishop, and afraid of his own command. Given that he was 10 when his father chose to betray Avestria join the Ecclesia, he is seen as either a traitor, or a person who simple “fell into” his position, depending on who you ask
  - **Rumour:** He will be coming through Talonstone for a parade in a couple weeks time

- High Inquisitor **Volodar Harar**
  - Leads the Redeemer's Inquisition (her mage hunters and secret police) in northern Vestran Province
  -  A silver haired High Elven man, who has an affinity for the colour white and wears a symbolic half-mask
