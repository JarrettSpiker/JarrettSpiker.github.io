 _Word has arrived in the Kingdom of Faldaria that invasion comes from across the mountains; the Armies of the Redeemer will arrive in spring, looking to seize the Kingdom and eliminate all of the mages who live within it. The King has sent for aid, but it will not arrive in time, if it comes at all. You have been selected for a desperate mission: enter enemy territory, and wreak havoc, sew dissent, inspire fear...whatever it takes to stop the invasion_
