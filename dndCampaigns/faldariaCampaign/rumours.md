### [&#8666; Faldaria Campaign](index.html)

## The Whispering Hand

_Here is what Brood learned when he went looking for information on whether there were any secret mage organizations in Vestran Province_

There is rumoured to be a secret group of Mages and mage sympathizers in the Ecclesia, and particularly in old Avestria. They are called the **Whispering Hand**.

 They act as an underground railroad, hiding spellcasters from the Redeemer’s Inquisition and getting them to safety. Sometimes this means across the border into the Freemarches or Faldaria, or preferably into Five Spire.

It is rumoured that Five Spire supports the Whispering Hand directly

## Banned Substances in the Ecclesia

_Here is what Brood learned when he went looking for information on whether there were any banned substances in the Ecclesia that the populace were upset about_

Despite being very “law and order”, the Ecclesia doesn't ban much in terms of substances. Liquor and most drugs are legal, though public disturbances arising from their use are quickly reprimanded.

However, the Ecclesia is very harsh against arcane magic and practitioners of other religions. This means that materials obviously being used as **spell components** (e.g. bat wings, eye of newt), draw the attention of the Inquisition.

 Additionally, there is a hallucinogen called **night moss** which is used in small doses by many followers of the Radiant Ones to “become closer” with their gods; because of this connection to a different religion, night moss is also banned.


## Ecclesian leaders in Vestran Province
*Here is what Helena learned when she went looking for a “who’s who” in the Ecclesia (I am focusing this on Vestran Province, as that is where the party is headed to begin with).*

- Edwin Briggs
  -  Governor of Vestran Province
  -  18 y.o. human. Governs Verstran Province from the city of Briggs Harbour.
  - His father sided, an Avestrian lord, sided with the Ecclesia in the invasion. As a reward he was granted governorship over the Ecclesia, but was killed towards the end of the war. The title passed on to Edwin
  - **Rumour:** Under the thumb of the Archbishop, and afraid of his own command. Given that he was 10 when his father chose to betray Avestria join the Ecclesia, he is seen as either a traitor, or a person who simple “fell into” his position, depending on who you ask
  - **Rumour:** He will be coming through Talonstone for a parade in a couple weeks time


 - Archbishop Kellian De’Fris
    -  Leader of the Church of the Redeemer in Vestran Province
    -  Half Elven woman, originally from Redeemer’s Grace (the capital of the Ecclesia)
    - Known as a ruthless persecutor of Clerics of the Radiant Ones, and oversaw the destruction of Aurestar
    - **Rumour:** Reviled but deeply feared by the common people of Vestran Province. Her dissenters, illegal mages/clerics or not, are known to disappear or turn up dead.

 - Magistrate Barretta Blackstone
    - DeFacto Mayor of Talonstone, and leader of the soldiers/guards garrisoned there
    - Dwarven woman. Originally of common blood, she made her riches as an independent miner. After the war, she effectively bought herself a title within the Ecclesia so that she could live an easier life.
    - Known as a competent, if dispassionate leader, mostly interested in keeping things running smoothly and maintaining the status quo.
    - **Rumour:** A passionate drinker and gambler, known to stake huge bets when she gets on a roll. Prefers simple pleasures over “highborn fancies”, and not ashamed to show it.

 - Bishop Ebert Knotwise
    - The bishop in charge of Talonstone
    - A halfling man originally from Deepgrove
    - Known more as a preacher than an administrator, and generally well liked by the people of Talonstone
    - **Rumour:** Despite being known as a fairly welcoming man, keeps almost entirely to himself on his own time. Takes regular missionary trips into the countryside alone, and is rumoured to have been spotted far afield from where he claimed to be travelling
