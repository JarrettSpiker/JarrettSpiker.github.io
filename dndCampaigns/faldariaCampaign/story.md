### [&#8666; Faldaria Campaign](index.html)

## Session 1

We began our story in the city of Celesia, where we meet our adventurers. **Dimitria Norixius**, a dragonborn monk from the Wyvern's Shadow monastery near Tor Vethren. **Gergee** the half-gnome mercenary, who saved a drowning man. **Brood** the Shifter from the Davrak Steppes, adept both on the battlefield and in the dark alleyways of the city. **Helena VonHubris** a Five Spire trained Tiefling sorceress, and Faldaria's Minister for the Promotion and Protection of Sorcery, who narrowly escapes an assassination attempt by the Redeemer's Inquisition. And **Roger Willpot**, an apprentice court Bard, who debuted his original song _"The King Takes to His Fork"_ to the Court of the Nine stars.

The adventurers were brought to the Court of Nine starts by the King's Guard **Oswyn Willpot**, Chancellor **Erys Fiveclover**, and court bard **Carlyle Fancifoote**. There the King of Faldaria **Sybald Brightwind** gave them their mission: delay or prevent an impending invasion from the Ecclesia for as possible, so that Faldaria may gather its allies and prepare.

Accepting the quest, the party, Helena in particular,  convinced Oswyn "The Stag" Willpot (who also happens to be Roger's older brother) to join them. They were provisioned and given quarters, while Helena and Brood gathered what [rumours](rumours.html) they could of Vestran Province (the closest and most recent province of the Ecclesia).

The party travelled across the Southern Reach to the Crystal Pass, where they witnessed Faldaria preparing for war: defenses being constructed and new barracks being built.

While crossing the Pass, a storm threatened the party, who needed to make the hard choice between settling in and weathering it, or trying to outrun it. With much effort, some sprained ankles and some exhaustion, the blizzard was outrun, and the party arrived at the last past before the descent into Vestran.

...and there, they met an ambush! A group of Kobolds, shouting praises for the Prophet of the Redeemer, appearing from the folds of the pass and raining stones down upon them, and Ice Mephits blinding them with fog.

The party scaled the pass and made quick work of most of the Kobolds, but at the sound of a bone chilling roar, they learned that the true danger was still to come. The remaining Kobold soldiers fled at the sight of two giant Yetis appearing at the top of the pass.

With Brood and Dimitria holding off one yeti, and the rest taking on the other, the adventurers vanquished one beast and the other fled.
