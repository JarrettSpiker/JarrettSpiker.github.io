### [&#8666; Faldaria Campaign](index.html)

## Session 1

We began our story in the city of Celesia, where we meet our adventurers. **Dimitria Norixius**, a dragonborn monk from the Wyvern's Shadow monastery near Tor Vethren. **Gergee** the half-gnome mercenary, who saved a drowning man. **Brood** the Shifter from the Davrak Steppes, adept both on the battlefield and in the dark alleyways of the city. **Helena VonHubris** a Five Spire trained Tiefling sorceress, and Faldaria's Minister for the Promotion and Protection of Sorcery, who narrowly escapes an assassination attempt by the Redeemer's Inquisition. And **Roger Willpot**, an apprentice court Bard, who debuted his original song _"The King Takes to His Fork"_ to the Court of the Nine stars.

The adventurers were brought to the Court of Nine starts by the King's Guard **Oswyn Willpot**, Chancellor **Erys Fiveclover**, and court bard **Carlyle Fancifoote**. There the King of Faldaria **Sybald Brightwind** gave them their mission: delay or prevent an impending invasion from the Ecclesia for as possible, so that Faldaria may gather its allies and prepare.

Accepting the quest, the party, Helena in particular,  convinced Oswyn "The Stag" Willpot (who also happens to be Roger's older brother) to join them. They were provisioned and given quarters, while Helena and Brood gathered what [rumours](rumours.html) they could of Vestran Province (the closest and most recent province of the Ecclesia).

The party travelled across the Southern Reach to the Crystal Pass, where they witnessed Faldaria preparing for war: defenses being constructed and new barracks being built.

While crossing the Pass, a storm threatened the party, who needed to make the hard choice between settling in and weathering it, or trying to outrun it. With much effort, some sprained ankles and some exhaustion, the blizzard was outrun, and the party arrived at the last past before the descent into Vestran.

...and there, they met an ambush! A group of Kobolds, shouting praises for the Prophet of the Redeemer, appearing from the folds of the pass and raining stones down upon them, and Ice Mephits blinding them with fog.

The party scaled the pass and made quick work of most of the Kobolds, but at the sound of a bone chilling roar, they learned that the true danger was still to come. The remaining Kobold soldiers fled at the sight of two giant Yetis appearing at the top of the pass.

With Brood and Dimitria holding off one yeti, and the rest taking on the other, the adventurers vanquished one beast and the other fled.

## Session 2

Some exhausted, some a bit worse for wear, the party makes its way out of the Crystal Pass into the mining town of Talonstone. Gergee, having done some mercenary work in Talonstone a few years ago, leads the group to the Happy Gnome Inn and Tavern.

There, the adventurers met the innkeeper **Boris Burrowfoot**, a gnomish man who is excited to see Gergee the Giant back in town, and informs him that an old acquaintance by the name of **Amaranth** hs been through earlier in the week.
They meet **Javette Durond**, an Ocredian Human captain of the Silver Legion sent to deal with monsters in the area after being injured on the front lines near the Pits of Emberfell. Despite seeming unimpressed with Roger, Helena, and Gergee, Javette offers them work helping her hunt some of the monsters which have been causing disturbances in the area.
Finally, they meet **Jorin Ashunter**, a former Knight of Avestria and wartime friend of Oswyn, and not a lieutenant of **The Cranes**, an Avestrian resistance movement inside the Ecclesia.

Jorin reveals to the party that the local sect of the Cranes have been crippled after a run-in with a nearby garrison, where three of their senior members were captured. Jorin worries for the safety of his compatriots, but also about what they may reveal once they are transported from the garrison to the **Hall of Judgement** in Talonstone where the torturers of the Redeemer's Inquisition wait. 

The adventurers commit to help Jorin, and set about preparing to free the Crane prisoners. Brood hunts down the Kobolds who fled from the Crystal Pass, learning that magistrate and commander of the local forces **Barretta Blackstone** stationed them in the Pass, before eliminating them permanently. Brood, Gergee, and Oswyn scout out the garrison, and decide that a roadside ambush will be more effective than attempting to sneak into the garrison's fortifications. Meanwhile Helena, Roger, and Dimitria masquerade as agents of the local Bishop **Ebert Knotwise** to enter the Hall of Judgement, and learn the planned date and route of the prisoner transport. 

Regrouping at the Happy Gnome, the party informs Jorin of the plan, and set about preparing for their ambush...

## Session 3

With Jorin accompanying them, the party sets up camp at the ambush location found by Gergee three days prior. Roger unveils and new song of their exploits in the Crystal Pass while the group plans their ambush.

Blocking escape with felled trees, the party lies in wait. Cavalry Scouts of the Redeemers army are swiftly dealt with by Brood, and the prisoner transport falls easily into their ambush.

A full unit of the Redeemer's Army, infantrymen, spearmen, and archers, led by a brave sergeant escort an ironclad wagon transporting the captured Cranes. To the party's suprise, two members of the Redeemer's Inquisition trail behind: a Warlock of the Redeemer, and his masked bodyguard.

The party springs their trap, and a fierce combat erupts. Brood, Jorin, and Gergee fight a swarm of enemies near the back of the wagon, with both Brood and Jorin nearly paying for the effort with their lives. Advancing through a haze of smoke created by Brood, Oswyn assaults from the flank, while Roger, Helena, and Dimitria rain magic and arrows down upon the Redeemer's Army.

The Inquisition Bodyguard falls to attacks from Brood and Gergee; the sergeant to hellfire, martial arts, and and shattering magic from Helena, Dimitria, and Roger; and the Warlock of the Redeemer is incapacitated with hideous laughter by Roger before being burnt to ash by Helena. Seeing their leaders dead, the remaining soldiers flee in all directions.

With the danger gone, Jorin helps pull his compatriots out of the wagon. A human man, dark haired and attractive, who begins tending to the wounded. A dwarven woman, full of confidence. A tall dragonborn man, with whom he shares an embrace.

And finally, to Jorin's suprise, he pulls a fourth person out of the wagon: a teenage halfling girl with matted hair and tattered clothes. A fourth prisoner, where he only expected three...

## Session 4

Surveying the results of the ambush, the party meets the prisoners they have rescued. **Sethkan**, Jorin's right-hand-man in the Talonstone Cranes; **Derna Deepview**, the Crane's quartermaster; **Ferdinand Farspirit**  a former cleric of the Radiant Ones; and the terrified halfling girl **Alita**. Character details and images can be found in [the characters page](characters.html) Winning over the trust of Alita, Roger and Helena learn that she is a young sorcerer who has been in hiding from the Redeemer's Inquisition.

Jorin brings the party back to the Crane's hideout, a hollowed out cellar beneath the Happy Gnome, where the other members of the Cranes are overjoyed to see the return of their captured compatriots. Helena, with Alita as a faithful assistant, teaches the assembled Cranes some slight-of-hand magic, and encourages them to spread the tricks around the people of Talonstone

Thankful for the party's help, Jorin and Sethkan promise their support to the party. While Jorin encourages the party to try and win the support of the people, and win allies among the other enemies of the Ecclesia (like Five Spire, Tor Vethren, and the Free Marches), Sethkan encourages them to sew dissent in the Ecclesia ranks by targeting their leaders. The local commander/magistrate Barretta Blackstone is known for only acting in her own self interest, the local bishop Ebert Knotwise is charismatic, but something of a recluse, and the governor of all of Vestran province, Edwin Briggs, will be parading through town in just over a week's time.

Ferdinand also encourages the party to help get Alita safely out of Talonstone, where an accidental use of her magic could bring the Inquisition down on their heads.

The party forms some tentative plans:
* Try to win the support of Barretta, if possible
* Eliminate Ebert Knotwise and attempt to replace him with a stand in
* Get Alita into the care of the Whispering Hand, a underground railroad for mages rumoured to be run by Five Spire

Jorin sets up a meeting with his Whispering Hand contact, who Dimitria agrees to meet the following evening. Helena, Roger, and Brood head to the Last Dance, the known Haunt of Barretta Blackstone and her private military organisation: the Blackstone Mercenaries.

At the Last Dance, Helena ingratiates herself to Barretta, turning up her characteristic charm as alias "Susanna von Sweet". She learns that Barretta is a proud, self-made-woman, who once trained as an elite warrior in the Mountain Dwarf stronghold of Tor Vethren, one of only a handful of Hill Dwarves ever to do so, before she was kicked out. Roger learns that the mercenaries are loyal to Barretta, who pays them well out of her personal wealth, but they are always recruiting skilled fighters. He learns that the "try out" for admission to the mercenaries is a duel with Barretta herself: a combat that no challenger has ever won.
Seeing an opportunity, Brood petitions to join the Blackstone Mercenaries, and (perhaps in an effort to impress Helena) Barretta offers to test Brood right then and there, with a duel out front of the Last Dance...

## Session 5

A crowd gathers outside of the Last Dance as Barretta and Brood square off to duel. The two trade a series of blows, and Brood manages to nearly defeat Barretta before she unleashed a final burst of strength and pushes Brood to the brink of death. Nevertheless, Barretta and the crowd are both impressed, and she invites Brood to join the Blackstone Mercenaries. **Novu**, a one-eyed orcish lieutenant, provided Brood with a uniform: a black tunic and cloak, both emblazoned with Barretta's personal sigil of a broken hammer. Brood tells Novu that messages can be left for him at the Rune Forged Dagger, a local inn.

Enjoying the celebration erupting in the Last Dance, Roger enjoys more black-rot than many patrons of the bar consider survivable, and puts on a rousing drunken performance, leading the band in an improvised series of songs. Full of good cheer, he convinces Brood to join him in a final round of drink...and they soon find themselves being dragged, half conscious, out of the bar.

Meanwhile, Barretta has pulled "Susanna Von Sweet" to a private table, where flirting between the two continues. Before long, Barretta has invited Susanna back to the magistrate's mansion for some better drink and (as they admit to the entire bar) to fuck. 
Once at the manor, Helena makes a bold play: She reveals her true name and magical powers, and asks Barretta to remain neutral in the upcoming war in exchange for favours from Faldaria should they win. Barretta remains taciturn on the matter, but rather than reporting the illegal sorceress in her quarters, the two turn from business to pleasure.

Across the city, back at the Happy Gnome, Jorin tells Dimitria it is time to meet their contacts in the Whispering Hand. Alita in tow, they sneak across the city, coming to a knickknacks store run by an aging wheelchair-bound White Islander called **Bilry**.
Bilry waits for them in his store along with two younger White Islands men: the wiry, diminutive **Gull**, and the hulking **Petrel**. Bilry tells Dimitria that the Whispering Hand can get Alita far away from the city by bringing her to a smuggler's cover downriver run by a man called **Ulric**. However, through a contact in the local government, he has learned that wanted posters for Alita will soon be put up across the city. Afraid to send Alita alone with only Gull and Petrel for protection, Bilry asks Dimitria to escort them as far as Ulric's cove. Dimitria agrees. Delayed only by Gull's need to tie up some loose ends in the city, the group agrees to head out immediately.

While she waits, Dimitria asks Bilry about some of the talismans he sells in the shop. He tells her that they are White Islands creations, made to appease the gods of the sea and skies. One in particular, he reveals, was given to him by an old friend, a storm sorcerer, which he believes to have real power. Since she has agreed to help Alita, Bilry offers to sell it to Dimitria on her return.

Gergee is simply trying to enjoy an evening at the Happy Gnome when Jorin returns to tell him that Dimitiria is headed out of the city with Alita that very night. Gergee and Jorin make their way to the Last Dance, where they find Brood and Roger passed out out-front. With some minor first aid applied to Brood, they manage to get their two drunken companions back to the Happy Gnome. Seeing that they wouldn't be much help right away, Gergee fetches Oswyn from his rooms, and together they meet Dimitria, Gull, Petrel, and Alita on their way out of the city

## Session 6

In the master bedroom of the magistrate's mansion, Barretta gives Helena some mixed news. She does not feel any loyalty to the Ecclesia, and would be more than happy to pull her mines and mercenaries free of their taxes. However, she does not believe that Faldaria has any chance of winning the war to come, and isn't willing to openly defy the Ecclesia (even by refusing to fight) for the sake of a doomed country. If Helena wants Barretta on her side, or even to remain indifferent, she will need to find a way to convince the magistrate that it will be worth the risk...

Returning to the Happy Gnome, to find Roger and Brood drunk, and Oswyn gone, Helena falls into tears in the bed of the Faldarian Paladin. Soon after, once Brood and Roger have sobered up a bit, Jorin them together with Helena and lets them know where Gergee and Dimitria are headed.

Dimitria, Gergee, Oswyn, Gull, Petrel, and Alita travel south along the road, headed for Ulric's Cove. On their journey, Dimitria thinks she sees a dark shape trailing them through the trees, but the party encounters no danger until the stumble upon an aggregated Girallon. They are ambushed by an aggravated Girallon. Brood, Helena, and Roger rejoin the party just in time to see the Girallon defeated.

Petrel leads the group to Ulric's Cove, a sheltered section of the river where a dock has been built into the cliffs which make up the bank. A caged Girallon is kept at the base of the cliffs, and a boat has been hoisted up out of the water and is being modified to carry the beast. They are greeted by a man called Ulric, who asks half the group to hide in the Cove's warehouse while he speaks with some in his office.

The group in the warehouse finds a hidden body, and soon learns that they are not free to leave. Meanwhile, in the office, the man who runs the Cove asks for all the groups money in exchange for Alita's safe passage. Alarmed, they deduce that this man is not Ulric, nor is he a member of the Whispering Hand...

## Session 7

A side quest, which takes us back in time and across the continent, to the edge of the World Scar south of the Rotwood. A squad of Silver Legion has just returned from a long ranging mission new recruits Cameron and Ferris; Clerics Arameia and Garrus; the warrior Shayla; and their esteemed leader Javette Durond. Rather than getting to a well deserved rest, the squadron is called to investigate a strange occurrence. The bell inside a long abandoned church of Cherebor, the Radiant One of the Afterlife has tolled 12 times at dawn, dusk, and midnight for tha last several nights. Every party who has gone to investigate, Silver Legion and Redeemer Priests, have disappeared.

The tale of this adventure will be, of course, be told in epic spoken word tales for years to come, and does not need repeating. Suffice it to say, Javette lost most of her hand to an Otyugh, but despite some close calls the entire party (amazingly) survived the harrowing experience.

Not long after, her shield hand maimed, Javette is posted away from the dangers of the World Scar, as a Silver Legion monster hunter in the safe little city of Talonstone...

## Session 8

In Ulric's Cove, the separated party quickly exchange a Message before fighting breaks out. The group in the warehouse, cornered, protect Alita while fighting their way through a swarm of smugglers. In Ulric's office, the most dangerous foes proves to be a very slippery table, which only the Monk training of Dimitria can best (as well as the imposter, and leader of the smugglers here, soon after).

Meeting back at the docks, Petrel tells the group he can take Alita the rest of the way, if they can get down river. The party rests as Gull offers to figure out the mechanism which can get the Cove's hoisted boat back in the water.

Roger regales the party with a tale he heard of their Talonstone acquaintance Javette, before setting about trying to figure out the Cove's crane and boat on his own. He makes some progress moving the crane, before the mechanism audibly breaks, and Gull calls him into the gearhouse below. There, he sees that the gears which power the crane have been sabotaged...and feels Gulls knife in his back.

Gull confesses his betrayal, preferring the money of the Ecclesia over the ideology of Bilry and the Whispering Hand. Clutching a bronze medallion around his neck, he calls out, and war horns blare from the forest above.

The party springs into battle as Church of the Redeemer soldiers begin to pour into the Cove. Dimitria and Gergee rush into the gearhouse, and together with Roger they knock Gull unconscious. Brood rushes to the gate of the Cove, and manages to bar the way of several soldiers while Oswyn rushes to help him. Helena transforms into a sea monster, and scoops Alita to safety in the river.

The Redeemer's soldiers break through the gate, and Brood scrambles to use the crane to put the boat into the river. In an impressive feat of strength, Roger shoves the broken gear back into place, and Brood is able to swing the boat out over the river...but not lower it.

As Gergee and Dimitria fight the soldiers climbing down over the cliff's edge, Oswyn holds the stairs to the docks. Dimitria leaps up onto the boat, and Brood climbs up the crane, both trying to cut the boat free. Roger breaks the Girallon's cage, and Helena convinces it that the Church of the Redeemer's soldiers are its enemies.

With a Girallon loose on the docks, and more Church soldiers pilling in, the party fights to escape...

## Session 9

With Church of the Redeemer soldiers pouring into Ulric's Cove, the party scrambles into the boat. Covering their escape, the party sees a dark eyed elven woman in a green cloak hidden amongst the trees firing arrows down into the Ecclesia's ranks.

The party slips downstream, out of the Church's grasp, and set up camp as night begins to fall, and members of the party share some quiet moments together.

In the morning, with Petrel's consent, the party (minus Oswyn and Alita) interrogate Gull. They learn that the Inquisition paid him 500gp to betray the Whispering Hand, which he planned to use to flee to the Free Marches. He has told the Inquisition where Bilry lives, given them a description of Dimitria (the only member of the party he saw before leaving Talonstone), and agreed to lead a group of Redeemer's Soldiers to Ulric's Cove. He shows the group the magical bronze medallion he was given in order to summon the soldiers to the Cove, which the party takes from him.

Despite keeping his end of the deal, after much debate the party decides to kill Gull. Petrel gives his old shipmate a facsimile of a White Islander funeral in the river, and shortly thereafter it is time to move on.

The party decides to return to Talonstone, while Petrel takes Alita the rest of the way to safety. It is a tearful goodbye as Roger gives Alita his silver pan flute, and the party promises to see Alita again one day when she has become a great sorceress of Five Spire.

## Session 10

Returning to Talon Stone, the party immediately head to Bilry's shop. They find the building burnt to the ground, with no sign of Bilry, alive or otherwise. Interviewing the shopkeeper across the way, who sells them some very dashing feathered cowboy hats, they learn that no one has seen Bilry since the blaze, and that (unusually) members of the Inquisition were seen shepherding people away from the building as it burned.

Gergee and Dimitria returned to the Crane's hideout beneath the Happy Gnome to tell Jorin what has happened. Meanwhile, the rest of the party head to the abandoned tavern where Gull hid the first half of his 200gp reward. They find the gold, as well as something else interesting: a Clerk of the Church, whom they had previously met at the Hall of Judgement, buying Nightmoss from a drug dealer. Helena confronts the man, who tells her that he is there to buy the drug for Ebert Knotwise, the Redeemer Bishop in charge of Talonstone. Helena tells the clerk to complete his task, and keep quite about being caught for fear that he will meet the same fate coming to the Bishop.

The group makes a stop at the Rune Forged Dagger to check for any messages from Barretta, and a letter with orders from Novu awaits Brood. They reach varying levels of intoxication, before returning to the Happy Gnome for the night.

Novu's letter:
*Brood,*

*We have your first job for you. Time to prove you are Blackstone material. Job details follow. Rules are you have 48 hours to let us know if you want the job or not, but  don't expect more chances any time soon if you flake on your first opportunity.*

*The sewers around the port district have been backing up all over the place. Barretta sent down some civilians to look into it yesterday, and we haven't heard from them since. Not a military matter, so we are paying the Mercenaries to deal with this out of the city's budget. New recruits get the shit jobs, ha.*

*You can access the sewers from behind the portmaster's quarters near the river. Figure out what's going on and deal with it. 50gp reward, report back when its done.*

*You can reach me at the Last Dance. If you want to split the reward, we can provide you with backup...or you can risk your neck going in alone. Barrett seems to think you're promising. Dont fuck it up.*

*Novu*

## Session 11

With Helena, Gergee, and Ferdinand spending the morning tracking Bishop Ebert Knotwise, the rest of the party takes on Brood's first missions as a member of the Blackstone Mercenaries. Heading to the port district, they descend into the sewers of Talonstone.

Emerging into a large basin of murky brown-grey wastewater, the party finds slightly iridescent violet fungus growing over the walls, conglomerating into nodules blocking off several pipes. They also find three giant rats feasting on what can only be the corpses of the civilians sent down by Barretta the previous day.

The group sets to work clearing away the fungus, and clearing out the rats (both of which put up a fight). Distracted, Roger does not notice as a sewer crocodile emerges and pulls him into the water. As Brood begins fully hurling giant rats at the swarming crocodiles, Dimitria leaps onto Rogers assailant, and raining down blows.

Swimming through sewage from crocodile to crocodile, Dimitria clears the way for Roger. The young bard makes it back to the basin landing just as a savage bite from a crocodile (currently being straddled by Dimitria the Crocborn, as Oswyn puts it) and drops him to 0hp for the first time in his poor young bardic life.

Oswyn revives his brother, as Dimitria and Brood finish of the last of their enemies. Tired, injured, and covered in sewage (other than Oswyn, who is still squeaky clean), the party clears the rest of the fungus and makes their way back up to the streets, eager for a bath at the Happy Gnome.

For a brief moment, the only person left in the sewers is Brood, checking the bodies for loot. As the group's torches fade away his dark vision kicks in. Across the basin, in a doorway from which he has heard skittering noises throughout the fight, he sees a shape silhouetted. A six foot tall humanoid, standing upright, with a wormlike tail, and the gleaming, beady eyes and teeth of a rat. As he watches, he sees the figure look at him, swish its tail, and turn and walk away, deeper into the sewers...

## Session 12

The party reassembles in the Cranes hideout...and are immediately expelled upstairs to bathe. Fast forward one hour of bathing for three of the party members, and a strategy meeting in Jorin's office, the group settles on a plan. Attend Bishop Ebert Knotwise's sermon, tail him out of the city, coerce whatever information they can out of him...and then decide if he his more useful as a blackmail victim or a corpse.

The Bishop's sermon is full of messages of love for the Redeemer, as is the conversation he provides the group when they catch up with him outside of the city. He tells them how the Prophet of the Redeemer herself healed his lamed legs during a visit to Deep Grove decades ago, and how he has devoted his life to the Redeemer ever since.

Near dusk, the Bishop bids adieu of the party and head off of the main road into the woods. The party tracks him along what seems to be an old game trail, until they spot him approaching a massive wall of brambles. Ebert moves a loose section of bramble aside with his knotted staff and slips inside.

Rather than following, Dimitria climbs a nearby tree to peer inside the veil of brambles. Inside she sees a wide clearing full of strange and wonderful plants, fully encased in the brambles. Giant mushrooms serve as tables, with smaller toadstools serving as seating around them. Berries, fruits, and nuts cover a bar made of a still-living log. A bubbling clear spring rises up in one corner, and near the back ladders lead into raised platforms amongst the trees. Among this, gnomes and elves in druidic garbs bustle about. Seated at one mushroom table is the bishop, alongside several druids as well as a pair of wearing sigils of the Radiant Ones.

Dimitria carries Roger into the treetops, and as Roger magically disguises himself as an elderly man he is tossed down into the clearing.

The druids and the Bishop quickly help Roger to his feet, and offer him a seat at their table. Roger deceives the group, assuming the name Fredrick Khan, a man who has been persecuted by the Ecclesia and seeking sanctuary. Ebert tells Fredrick that he will be safe in this place, and reveals to him that while he devoutly believes in the Church, and that Arcane magic must be eliminated, he is opposed to the ferocity with which the Inquisition perseus this task.

The conversation at the table falls into a friendly religious debate, and before long the Bishop offers Nightmoss he has smuggled out of the city to the Radiant One priests. As they slip into religious trances, Roger is offered the Nightmoss pipe, which he accepts.

As the Nightmoss takes hold on Roger's mind he is pulled into a deeper, much older forest. The trees rise almost out of sight, and the space is lit by a dim morning glow. From between the trees Roger sees a massive shifting shape approach...first a stag and then a hawk and then a bear....and then standing before him, a woman like nothing he has ever seen. She stands twenty feet tall, garbed in leaves and moonlight. Hawks wings sprout from her back, a wolf's claws tip her fingers, and she looks down smiling at Roger with six human eyes. The woman speaks to Roger as if she knows him, she speaks of his family and his King, and of the quest he is on. When Roger asks her name, she trades the knowledge for a song: Felurian.

As the Nightmoss begins to fade, Felurian tells Roger she hopes she will see him again, in this life or the next...and Roger finds himself, mind hazy, back in the druid's grove

## Session 13

Taking his leave of the Sanctuary, a disguised Roger reconvenes with the party as night falls on the forest. Unsettled by his vision, Roger pulls his brother aside to discuss it. A shocked Oswyn reveals to Roger that Felurian us an old Faldarian name for the Queen of the Fae Courts, and old ally of Faldaria before the Wrending. The Kings Guard honour Felurian by choosing their totem beast after one of her forms (Stag, Hawk, Bear, etc)

The party decides to enter the Sanctuary undisguised to rest there for the night, as Gergee senses the presence of another predator in the forest.

Through some skilled deception, they are welcomed by the Bishop and the Circle of druids who run the sanctuary, but their rest there is short. It is not long before they can hear the cries of the Bishop, who has left firefly hunting, echoing through the forest outside.

The party pursues the Bishop, and soon finds his two companions, Pixie and Trixie, asleep under the affect of a magical spell. A voice from the trees warns them to turn back, and while threats are exchanged Dimitria manages to sneak through the treetops and engage the elven ranger she encounters there.

The party sees the Bishop being dragged away by shambling humanoid creatures made entirely of vines, and become spread out across the forest trying to catch up as more plant creatures emerge from the woods to cut off their pursuit.

With arrows raining down from above, the party kills most of the plant monsters, and causes the elven rangers to flee, just in time to see the Bishop dragged in to a dark circle of trees.

## Session 14

Oswyn rushes ahead as the party scrambles to enter the circle of trees after the bishop, clearing the rest of the plant monsters standing in their way.

As they enter the circle of trees, they find a raised stone alter standing in the center, the Bishop held down against it by vine blights. To either side of the Bishop stand gnomish druids in dark robes. As the party watch another figure, a tall gaunt man with beady dark eyes and greased back hair, hands the druids a serrated dagger made out of the fang of some large beast, and then retreats as the druids begin to chant a ritual, holding the dagger aloft above Ebert's heart.

In front of the alter, Oswyn lays pinned to the ground by another pair of monsters molded of earth and vines. These beasts, however, are not slow and shambling. They resemble massive ten-foot-tall wolves, and eye their prey with all the bloodthirst of a true predator. 

A desperate battle to pull Oswyn out of danger and stop the ritual commences. Roger casts a cload of noxious gas, robbing the enemy of most of their ability to act, as Gergee and Brood rush to engage then wolves. Helena runs to Oswyn's aid, and together they pull free of the beasts' grasp.

Hidden amongst the treetops, Dimitria sees her party struggling against the wolves, and decides to take a more direct route to stopping the sacrificial ritual. She knocks an arrow, and fires on then Bishop. Roger follows suit, and with a powerful Shatter, he and Dimitria put a permanent end to Bishop Ebert Knotwise.

Helena messages the mysterious man, who introduces himself as **Vesmir** of the **Brethren of Rhalagai**, and motions for the enraged druids to call off their wolves.

After some tense back and forth questioning, and the re-emergence of the lead ranger from the forest (called **Brade** by his companions), the party learns that the druids and rangers belong to a recently formed druidic order called the **Dark Circle**. They have dedicated themselves to striking out at the Church of the Redeemer now, before her Inquisition can decide to persecute druidic magic as well. With the help of the Brethren, they have been sacrificing members of the Church to turn them into the Dark Circle Wolves the party has been fighting.

Vesmir engages Brood in conversation, who (after a long time) recognizes that Vesmir is also a Shifter, though not one of a tribe Brood has ever encountered before. Vesmir acknowledges that perhaps the interests of party aligns with his own, but demands an offering in exchange for the life of the Bishop before they can consider working together. Vesmir tells the party that if they bring a Priest of the Redeemer to an abandoned temple of Echran (the Radiant One of framers and the Harvest) 20km south of Talonstone, and wait there, they will be found.

With that, the druids mount their wolves and disappear into the forest. Vesmir's body begins to expand and shift, growing course grey fur and leathery wings, until he assumes the form of a 15 foot tall monstrous bat. A transformation Brood recognizes as something he has long been researching...the curse of Lycanthropy. The Werebat picks up Brade in its claws and they disappear into the night sky, leaving the party alone in the clearing with the body of Ebert Knotwise.

The [the characters page](characters.html) has been updated with these new characters and factions, for reference.

## Session 15

The party buries Ebert Knotwise in a shallow grave, and heads back to the Sanctuary for the night, claiming to the druids there that he was kidnapped by a group of true believers.

The party spends much of the next day resting in the Sanctuary, and arrive back in Talonstone in the evening. Returning to the Crane's hideout they hear excited whispers of a **"Duke Leto"** being spotted near Harden Hold. This is quickly overshadowed by news from a recently-returned Sethkan:  Governor Edwin Briggs is on his way, with more than just his retinue in tow. He is bringing the soldiers and materials to transform Talonstone into the staging ground for the coming invasion. The clock is ticking for Faldaria, but perhaps the party can use their position to deal to major blow to the governor's plans...

Come morning Helena decides that it is time to enact her plan to replace the Bishop. Fetching a charismatic young Crane by the name of Fabian, the party makes their way to the hall of judgement, intending to pose as representatives of the Archbishop and install Fabian as Ebert's replacement. Through the power of magic, and Roger's silver tongue, they make their way into the office of High Inquisitor **Volodar Harar**.

Susanna (Helena), her bodyguard Friedrich (Roger), and her secretary Brood (Brood), inform the skeptical Inquisitor that Ebert has been secretly killed at the Archbishop's orders, and that Fernando (Fabian) is to be his replacement. The High Inquisitor seems dubious at first, but after much convincing agrees to help settle Fernando into the role of Bishop while he awaits further confirmation from the Archbishop. He writes a letter to the Archbishop which he asks Helena to deliver, and sends "Sussana's" delegation on their way.

Nearly home-free, Helena, Roger, and Brood leave the office of the High Inquisitor, and encounter one final hitch: standing outside the High Inquisitor's door is Barretta Blackstone. Barretta recognizes Helena and Brood, but does not say anything as she enters the High Inquisitor's office and is introduced to the new "bishop".

In four days the governor will be bringing an army to town, and the party has more power, allies, and opportunities than ever before...but the might of the Redeemer has never been quite so close at hand...

## Session 16

Six years ago, during the Avestrian war.

For just over a year, war has embroiled the Holy Kingdom of Avestria. With the King and his royal family (minus the errant Duke Leto) defending the capital of Aurestar, Ecclesian troops run rampant over eastern Avestria.

Sir Jorin Ashunter of the Avestrian Knights (and his quire Sethkan) leads a regiment of troops skirmishing against Ecclesia forces in the east, cutting supply lines and liberating occupied towns. Recently they have been joined by reinforcements from the North: the Faldarian army led by King Sybald Brightwind. Among the Faldarian ranks is Oswyn Willpot of the Kings Guard, and a group of irregulars from the Wyvern’s Shadow monastery led by Master Ghesh.

With their newly conjoined strength the armies hope to start hitting the Ecclesia hard, and winning the decisive battles which will be necessary to turn the tide of the war. They do not have to wait long for their opportunity. The allied army receives a call for aid from Malcolm Briggs, lord of Briggs harbour and one of the most powerful holdouts in eastern Avestria. The walled city of Briggs harbour is nearly impenetrable when well defended, but Lord Briggs and the majority of his forces were caught outside the castle. Now, a superior Ecclesian force besieges Briggs harbour, with most of its defenders outside its walls.

Malcolm Briggs has requested that Jorin and Sybald's army join him in liberating Briggs harbour, and the people trapped within. After several days of hard march, they rendezvoused with the Briggs Harbour army north of the city. As heavy rains begin to fall, the commanders of the allied armies gather to plan their attack. They will assault the outnumbered Ecclesians, and drive them against the castle walls, where Briggs archers can rain arrows down upon them.

At dawn, the armies engage in the muddy fields north of Briggs harbour, fighting for control of the bridges across the river which separates them. With King Sybald's mages scorching swathes through the Ecclesians, the allied forces begin to overwhelm their foes...until Malcolm Briggs gives and order, and the Briggs Harbour ballista begins shooting not at the Redeemer's Armies, but at Oswyn.

Malcolm's soldier's circle around to engage Jorin and the Avestrian archers, while Malcolm leads his own honour guard to battle King Sybald. The Faldarian mages are quickly routed, but rather than flee to safety Sybald stands his ground and scatter Briggs's honour guard with a powerful thunderwave, leaving the Faldarian sorcerer king and one of Avestria's great lords to engage in single combat as the battle rages around them.

As Sethkan's own battalion is destroyed he rushes to help the King. The Wyvern's Fang monks, cleverly held in reserve, sweep in to save Jorin and his archers. Oswyn's troops, now trapped behind enemy lines (many of them his own brothers in the Kings Guard) flee to safety, leaving Oswyn alone surrounded by his enemies.

Just in time, the Ecclesians begin to route, and Oswyn fights his way back to his King. Ghesh's dragonborn monks suffer many casualties, and nearly break before Sethkan arrives to rally them. King Sybald, suffering terrible wounds, brings the traitor Malcolm to the brink of death with a Shadow Blade. The monks overrun Briggs, and at Ghesh's orders, kill him.

The few remaining Ecclesian troops flee the battlefield as the Faldarians and Avestrians regroup out of range of the Briggs Harbour walls. Dark armoured mercenaries lead by Barretta Blackstone arrive on a nearby cliff face, cutting any hope of storming the city. Nevertheless, what was meant to be a trap to destroy the armies of Avestria and Faldaria has resulted in a bloody route of the Ecclesia's troops, and left the Redeemer's new ally Malcolm Briggs dead for his treachery.

The armies now turn west, towards Aurestar, where the forces of the Redeemer gather in an attempt to put an end to the Avestrian king and capital...
