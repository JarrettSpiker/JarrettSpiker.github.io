### [&#8666; Faldaria Campaign](index.html)

## Session 1

We began our story in the city of Celesia, where we meet our adventurers. **Dimitria Norixius**, a dragonborn monk from the Wyvern's Shadow monastery near Tor Vethren. **Gergee** the half-gnome mercenary, who saved a drowning man. **Brood** the Shifter from the Davrak Steppes, adept both on the battlefield and in the dark alleyways of the city. **Helena VonHubris** a Five Spire trained Tiefling sorceress, and Faldaria's Minister for the Promotion and Protection of Sorcery, who narrowly escapes an assassination attempt by the Redeemer's Inquisition. And **Roger Willpot**, an apprentice court Bard, who debuted his original song _"The King Takes to His Fork"_ to the Court of the Nine stars.

The adventurers were brought to the Court of Nine starts by the King's Guard **Oswyn Willpot**, Chancellor **Erys Fiveclover**, and court bard **Carlyle Fancifoote**. There the King of Faldaria **Sybald Brightwind** gave them their mission: delay or prevent an impending invasion from the Ecclesia for as possible, so that Faldaria may gather its allies and prepare.

Accepting the quest, the party, Helena in particular,  convinced Oswyn "The Stag" Willpot (who also happens to be Roger's older brother) to join them. They were provisioned and given quarters, while Helena and Brood gathered what [rumours](rumours.html) they could of Vestran Province (the closest and most recent province of the Ecclesia).

The party travelled across the Southern Reach to the Crystal Pass, where they witnessed Faldaria preparing for war: defenses being constructed and new barracks being built.

While crossing the Pass, a storm threatened the party, who needed to make the hard choice between settling in and weathering it, or trying to outrun it. With much effort, some sprained ankles and some exhaustion, the blizzard was outrun, and the party arrived at the last past before the descent into Vestran.

...and there, they met an ambush! A group of Kobolds, shouting praises for the Prophet of the Redeemer, appearing from the folds of the pass and raining stones down upon them, and Ice Mephits blinding them with fog.

The party scaled the pass and made quick work of most of the Kobolds, but at the sound of a bone chilling roar, they learned that the true danger was still to come. The remaining Kobold soldiers fled at the sight of two giant Yetis appearing at the top of the pass.

With Brood and Dimitria holding off one yeti, and the rest taking on the other, the adventurers vanquished one beast and the other fled.

## Session 2

Some exhausted, some a bit worse for wear, the party makes its way out of the Crystal Pass into the mining town of Talonstone. Gergee, having done some mercenary work in Talonstone a few years ago, leads the group to the Happy Gnome Inn and Tavern.

There, the adventurers met the innkeeper **Boris Burrowfoot**, a gnomish man who is excited to see Gergee the Giant back in town, and informs him that an old acquaintance by the name of **Amaranth** hs been through earlier in the week.
They meet **Javette Durond**, an Ocredian Human captain of the Silver Legion sent to deal with monsters in the area after being injured on the front lines near the Pits of Emberfell. Despite seeming unimpressed with Roger, Helena, and Gergee, Javette offers them work helping her hunt some of the monsters which have been causing disturbances in the area.
Finally, they meet **Jorin Ashunter**, a former Knight of Avestria and wartime friend of Oswyn, and not a lieutenant of **The Cranes**, an Avestrian resistance movement inside the Ecclesia.

Jorin reveals to the party that the local sect of the Cranes have been crippled after a run-in with a nearby garrison, where three of their senior members were captured. Jorin worries for the safety of his compatriots, but also about what they may reveal once they are transported from the garrison to the **Hall of Judgement** in Talonstone where the torturers of the Redeemer's Inquisition wait. 

The adventurers commit to help Jorin, and set about preparing to free the Crane prisoners. Brood hunts down the Kobolds who fled from the Crystal Pass, learning that magistrate and commander of the local forces **Barretta Blackstone** stationed them in the Pass, before eliminating them permanently. Brood, Gergee, and Oswyn scout out the garrison, and decide that a roadside ambush will be more effective than attempting to sneak into the garrison's fortifications. Meanwhile Helena, Roger, and Dimitria masquerade as agents of the local Bishop **Ebert Knotwise** to enter the Hall of Judgement, and learn the planned date and route of the prisoner transport. 

Regrouping at the Happy Gnome, the party informs Jorin of the plan, and set about preparing for their ambush...
