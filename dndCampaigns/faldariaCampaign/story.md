### [&#8666; Faldaria Campaign](index.html)

## Session 1

We began our story in the city of Celesia, where we meet our adventurers. **Dimitria Norixius**, a dragonborn monk from the Wyvern's Shadow monastery near Tor Vethren. **Gergee** the half-gnome mercenary, who saved a drowning man. **Brood** the Shifter from the Davrak Steppes, adept both on the battlefield and in the dark alleyways of the city. **Helena VonHubris** a Five Spire trained Tiefling sorceress, and Faldaria's Minister for the Promotion and Protection of Sorcery, who narrowly escapes an assassination attempt by the Redeemer's Inquisition. And **Roger Willpot**, an apprentice court Bard, who debuted his original song _"The King Takes to His Fork"_ to the Court of the Nine stars.

The adventurers were brought to the Court of Nine starts by the King's Guard **Oswyn Willpot**, Chancellor **Erys Fiveclover**, and court bard **Carlyle Fancifoote**. There the King of Faldaria **Sybald Brightwind** gave them their mission: delay or prevent an impending invasion from the Ecclesia for as possible, so that Faldaria may gather its allies and prepare.

Accepting the quest, the party, Helena in particular,  convinced Oswyn "The Stag" Willpot (who also happens to be Roger's older brother) to join them. They were provisioned and given quarters, while Helena and Brood gathered what [rumours](rumours.html) they could of Vestran Province (the closest and most recent province of the Ecclesia).

The party travelled across the Southern Reach to the Crystal Pass, where they witnessed Faldaria preparing for war: defenses being constructed and new barracks being built.

While crossing the Pass, a storm threatened the party, who needed to make the hard choice between settling in and weathering it, or trying to outrun it. With much effort, some sprained ankles and some exhaustion, the blizzard was outrun, and the party arrived at the last past before the descent into Vestran.

...and there, they met an ambush! A group of Kobolds, shouting praises for the Prophet of the Redeemer, appearing from the folds of the pass and raining stones down upon them, and Ice Mephits blinding them with fog.

The party scaled the pass and made quick work of most of the Kobolds, but at the sound of a bone chilling roar, they learned that the true danger was still to come. The remaining Kobold soldiers fled at the sight of two giant Yetis appearing at the top of the pass.

With Brood and Dimitria holding off one yeti, and the rest taking on the other, the adventurers vanquished one beast and the other fled.

## Session 2

Some exhausted, some a bit worse for wear, the party makes its way out of the Crystal Pass into the mining town of Talonstone. Gergee, having done some mercenary work in Talonstone a few years ago, leads the group to the Happy Gnome Inn and Tavern.

There, the adventurers met the innkeeper **Boris Burrowfoot**, a gnomish man who is excited to see Gergee the Giant back in town, and informs him that an old acquaintance by the name of **Amaranth** hs been through earlier in the week.
They meet **Javette Durond**, an Ocredian Human captain of the Silver Legion sent to deal with monsters in the area after being injured on the front lines near the Pits of Emberfell. Despite seeming unimpressed with Roger, Helena, and Gergee, Javette offers them work helping her hunt some of the monsters which have been causing disturbances in the area.
Finally, they meet **Jorin Ashunter**, a former Knight of Avestria and wartime friend of Oswyn, and not a lieutenant of **The Cranes**, an Avestrian resistance movement inside the Ecclesia.

Jorin reveals to the party that the local sect of the Cranes have been crippled after a run-in with a nearby garrison, where three of their senior members were captured. Jorin worries for the safety of his compatriots, but also about what they may reveal once they are transported from the garrison to the **Hall of Judgement** in Talonstone where the torturers of the Redeemer's Inquisition wait. 

The adventurers commit to help Jorin, and set about preparing to free the Crane prisoners. Brood hunts down the Kobolds who fled from the Crystal Pass, learning that magistrate and commander of the local forces **Barretta Blackstone** stationed them in the Pass, before eliminating them permanently. Brood, Gergee, and Oswyn scout out the garrison, and decide that a roadside ambush will be more effective than attempting to sneak into the garrison's fortifications. Meanwhile Helena, Roger, and Dimitria masquerade as agents of the local Bishop **Ebert Knotwise** to enter the Hall of Judgement, and learn the planned date and route of the prisoner transport. 

Regrouping at the Happy Gnome, the party informs Jorin of the plan, and set about preparing for their ambush...

## Session 3

With Jorin accompanying them, the party sets up camp at the ambush location found by Gergee three days prior. Roger unveils and new song of their exploits in the Crystal Pass while the group plans their ambush.

Blocking escape with felled trees, the party lies in wait. Cavalry Scouts of the Redeemers army are swiftly dealt with by Brood, and the prisoner transport falls easily into their ambush.

A full unit of the Redeemer's Army, infantrymen, spearmen, and archers, led by a brave sergeant escort an ironclad wagon transporting the captured Cranes. To the party's suprise, two members of the Redeemer's Inquisition trail behind: a Warlock of the Redeemer, and his masked bodyguard.

The party springs their trap, and a fierce combat erupts. Brood, Jorin, and Gergee fight a swarm of enemies near the back of the wagon, with both Brood and Jorin nearly paying for the effort with their lives. Advancing through a haze of smoke created by Brood, Oswyn assaults from the flank, while Roger, Helena, and Dimitria rain magic and arrows down upon the Redeemer's Army.

The Inquisition Bodyguard falls to attacks from Brood and Gergee; the sergeant to hellfire, martial arts, and and shattering magic from Helena, Dimitria, and Roger; and the Warlock of the Redeemer is incapacitated with hideous laughter by Roger before being burnt to ash by Helena. Seeing their leaders dead, the remaining soldiers flee in all directions.

With the danger gone, Jorin helps pull his compatriots out of the wagon. A human man, dark haired and attractive, who begins tending to the wounded. A dwarven woman, full of confidence. A tall dragonborn man, with whom he shares an embrace.

And finally, to Jorin's suprise, he pulls a fourth person out of the wagon: a teenage halfling girl with matted hair and tattered clothes. A fourth prisoner, where he only expected three...

## Session 4

Surveying the results of the ambush, the party meets the prisoners they have rescued. **Sethkan**, Jorin's right-hand-man in the Talonstone Cranes; **Derna Deepview**, the Crane's quartermaster; **Ferdinand Farspirit**  a former cleric of the Radiant Ones; and the terrified halfling girl **Alita**. Character details and images can be found in [the characters page](characters.html) Winning over the trust of Alita, Roger and Helena learn that she is a young sorcerer who has been in hiding from the Redeemer's Inquisition.

Jorin brings the party back to the Crane's hideout, a hollowed out cellar beneath the Happy Gnome, where the other members of the Cranes are overjoyed to see the return of their captured compatriots. Helena, with Alita as a faithful assistant, teaches the assembled Cranes some slight-of-hand magic, and encourages them to spread the tricks around the people of Talonstone

Thankful for the party's help, Jorin and Sethkan promise their support to the party. While Jorin encourages the party to try and win the support of the people, and win allies among the other enemies of the Ecclesia (like Five Spire, Tor Vethren, and the Free Marches), Sethkan encourages them to sew dissent in the Ecclesia ranks by targetting their leaders. The local commander/magistrate Barretta Blackstone is known for only acting in her own self interest, the local bishop Ebert Knotwise is charismatic, but something of a recluse, and the governor of all of Vestran province, Edwin Briggs, will be parading through town in just over a week's time.

Ferdinand also encourages the party to help get Alita safely out of Talonstone, where an accidental use of her magic could bring the Inquisition down on their heads.

The party forms some tentative plans:
* Try to win the support of Barretta, if possible
* Eliminate Ebert Knotwise and attempt to replace him with a stand in
* Get Alita into the care of the Whispering Hand, a underground railroad for mages rumoured to be run by Five Spire

Jorin sets up a meeting with his Whispering Hand contact, who Dimitria agrees to meet the following evening. Helena, Roger, and Brood head to the Last Dance, the known Haunt of Barretta Blackstone and her private military organisation: the Blackstone Mercenaries.

At the Last Dance, Helena ingratiates herself to Barretta, turning up her characteristic charm as alias "Susanna von Sweet". She learns that Barretta is a proud, self-made-woman, who once trained as an elite warrior in the Mountain Dwarf stronghold of Tor Vethren, one of only a handful of Hill Dwarves ever to do so, before she was kicked out. Roger learns that the mercenaries are loyal to Barretta, who pays them well out of her personal wealth, but they are always recruiting skilled fighrers. He learns that the "try out" for admission to the mercenaries is a duel with Barretta herself: a combat that no challenger has ever won.
Seeing an opportunity, Brood petitions to join the Blackstone Mercenaries, and (perhaps in an effort to impress Helena) Barretta offers to test Brood right then and there, with a duel out front of the Last Dance...

## Session 5

A crowd gathers outside of the Last Dance as Barretta and Brood square off to duel. The two trade a series of blows, and Brood manages to nearly defeat Barretta before she unleashed a final burst of strength and pushes Brood to the brink of death. Nevertheless, Barretta and the crowd are both impressed, and she invites Brood to join the Blackstone Mercenaries. **Novu**, a one-eyed orcish lieutenant, provided Brood with a uniform: a black tunic and cloak, both emblazoned with Barretta's personal sigil of a broken hammer. Brood tells Novu that messages can be left for him at the Rune Forged Dagger, a local inn.

Enjoying the celebration erupting in the Last Dance, Roger enjoys more black-rot than many patrons of the bar consider survivable, and puts on a rousing drunken performance, leading the band in an improvised series of songs. Full of good cheer, he convinces Brood to join him in a final round of drink...and they soon find themselves being dragged, half conscious, out of the bar.

Meanwhile, Barretta has pulled "Susanna Von Sweet" to a private table, where flirting between the two continues. Before long, Barretta has invited Susanna back to the magistrate's mansion for some better drink and (as they admit to the entire bar) to fuck. 
Once at the manor, Helena makes a bold play: She reveals her true name and magical powers, and asks Barretta to remain neutral in the upcoming war in exchange for favours from Faldaria should they win. Barretta remains taciturn on the matter, but rather than reporting the illegal sorceress in her quarters, the two turn from business to pleasure.

Across the city, back at the Happy Gnome, Jorin tells Dimitria it is time to meet their contacts in the Whispering Hand. Alita in tow, they sneak across the city, coming to a knickknacks store run by an aging wheelchair-bound White Islander called **Bilry**.
Bilry waits for them in his store along with two younger White Islands men: the wiry, diminutive **Gull**, and the hulking **Petrel**. Bilry tells Dimitria that the Whispering Hand can get Alita far away from the city by bringing her to a smuggler's cover downriver run by a man called **Ulric**. However, through a contact in the local government, he has learned that wanted posters for Alita will soon be put up across the city. Afraid to send Alita alone with only Gull and Petrel for protection, Bilry asks Dimitria to escort them as far as Ulric's cove. Dimitria agrees. Delayed only by Gull's need to tie up some loose ends in the city, the group agrees to head out immediately.

While she waits, Dimitria asks Bilry about some of the talismans he sells in the shop. He tells her that they are White Islands creations, made to appease the gods of the sea and skies. One in particular, he reveals, was given to him by an old friend, a storm sorcerer, which he believes to have real power. Since she has agreed to help Alita, Bilry offers to sell it to Dimitira on her return.

Gergee is simply trying to enjoy an evening at the Happy Gnome when Jorin returns to tell him that Dimitiria is headed out of the city with Alita that very night. Gergee and Jorin make their way to the Last Dance, where they find Brood and Roger passed out out-front. With some minor first aid applied to Brood, they manage to get their two drunken companions back to the Happy Gnome. Seeing that they wouldnt be much help right away, Gergee fetches Oswyn from his rooms, and together they meet Dimitria, Gull, Petrel, and Alita on their way out of the city
